I hold a Master of Science in Engineering ([MSEngineering](https://www.msengineering.ch)) from SUPSI, where I specialized in financial machine learning and reinforcement learning under the supervision of [Dr. Oleg Szehr](https://people.idsia.ch/~oleg/).

During my studies, I worked on several projects at [Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence USI-SUPSI](https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/). One project involved developing an MDL-based feature selector in PySpark. Another, co-authored with Dr. Oleg Szehr, explored the use of neural networks for financial portfolio optimization. In this work, we introduced a novel statistical method to detect overfitting in end-to-end machine learning-based portfolio optimization and investigated regularization techniques to stabilize neural network training. This research was published in [Risk’s Journal of Risk Model Validation](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-risk-model-validation), with the [editor noting](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-risk-model-validation/volume-17-number-3-september-2023): "This is a valuable paper, and Maggiolo and Szehr shed light on concerns that many of us have about neural networks."
We presented this work at the [Bachelier Finance Society](https://www.bachelierfinance.org/) 12th World Congress in Rio de Janeiro in July 2024.

My master’s thesis focused on applying reinforcement learning to derivatives hedging. We explored custom versions of MCTS-based algorithms and developed tailored AlphaZero and MuZero variants for hedging European, American, and multi-option strategies. Parts of this thesis are being published as a standalone research paper in collaboration with Dr. Oleg Szehr and Dr. Miroslav Strupl, to be presented at the SIAM Conference on Financial Mathematics and Engineering (FM25) in Miami.

After graduation, I co-founded Vigilant Analytics, a scientific consultancy firm that builds AI-driven solutions for private and public sector clients. Our core expertise lies in machine learning—particularly reinforcement learning, computer vision, and stochastic optimization.
