I hold a Master of Science in Engineering ([MSEngineering](https://www.msengineering.ch)) from SUPSI, where I specialized in financial machine learning and reinforcement learning under the supervision of Oleg Szehr.

During my studies, I worked on several projects at [Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence USI-SUPSI](https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/). One project involved developing an MDL-based feature selector in PySpark. Another, co-authored with [Oleg Szehr](https://people.idsia.ch/~oleg/), explored the use of neural networks for financial portfolio optimization. In this work, we introduced a novel statistical method to detect overfitting in end-to-end machine learning-based portfolio optimization and investigated regularization techniques to stabilize neural network training. This research was published in Risk’s Journal of Risk Model Validation, with the editor noting: "This is a valuable paper, and Maggiolo and Szehr shed light on concerns that many of us have about neural networks."
We presented this work at the Bachelier Finance Society 12th World Congress in Rio de Janeiro in July 2024.

My master’s thesis focused on applying reinforcement learning to derivatives hedging. We explored custom versions of MCTS-based algorithms and developed tailored AlphaZero and MuZero variants for hedging European, American, and multi-option strategies. Parts of this thesis are being published as a standalone research paper in collaboration with Oleg Szehr and Miroslav Strupl, to be presented at the SIAM Conference on Financial Mathematics and Engineering (FM25) in Miami.

After graduation, I founded Vigilant Analytics, a scientific consultancy firm that builds AI-driven solutions for private and public sector clients. Our core expertise lies in machine learning—particularly reinforcement learning, computer vision, and stochastic optimization.
